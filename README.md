# offers-app

The Offers App is an app used to review offers and save them as a favorite to view later.

I used this project as an opportunity to keep learning new things about the Android platform. I chose to use Kotlin because I am not as familiar with it as I would like to be, so I'm looking forward to hear what I did wrong! :) I also chose to use a couple tools that I have been interested in trying, Room for persistence and the Navigation Architecture Components, which ended up being fun to work with.
